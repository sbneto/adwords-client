Setup
=====

This package can be installed with pip or directly from this repo. To do so, just run

.. code:: bash

   pip install adwords-client

Or

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e git+https://github.com/getninjas/adwords-client.git#egg=adwords-client

Usage
=====

In order to test and run this package, you need some credentials from Google AdWords as
described here https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/signup.

By default, the ``autoload()`` method of the client looks for credentials in the following
environment variables:

::

   DEVELOPER_TOKEN=developer token here
   CLIENT_CUSTOMER_ID=id of the addcount you wish to manage by default
   CLIENT_ID=client id for the google API credentials
   CLIENT_SECRET=client secret for the google API credentials
   REFRESH_TOKEN=refresh token that should be manually generated

If these are not present, it fallsback to the file ``googleads.yaml`` in the project folder and,
if it does not exists, it looks for ``googleads.yaml`` inside the current users' home folder.
This file is as defined in the exaples at https://github.com/googleads/googleads-python-lib.
If none of these options are available, it raises an error.

For further information on usage, look into the
`tests/doctests <https://github.com/getninjas/adwords-client/tree/objects-creation/tests/doctests>`_
folder of this repo.
